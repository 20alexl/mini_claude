## MCP Tool Reference

### Essential Tools

#### `claude_engram_status()`

Check Claude Engram health (Ollama connection, model availability, memory stats, queue stats).

#### `session_start(project_path)`

Deep context load: memories, checkpoints, decisions, memory health, auto-cleanup. The SessionStart hook auto-starts a basic session, but this gives the full picture.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `project_path` | `str` | Yes | Project directory path |

#### `session_end(project_path?)`

Optional. Shows session summary. All memories auto-save without it.

#### `pre_edit_check(file_path)`

Unified check before editing: past mistakes, loop risk, scope status, scored memories.

### `memory` Tool (20 operations)

All operations require `operation` and `project_path`.

| Operation | Additional Parameters | Description |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| `remember` | `content`, `category?`, `relevance?` | Store a memory |
| `recall` | — | Get all memories for project |
| `forget` | — | Clear all project memories |
| `search` | `file_path?`, `tags?`, `query?`, `limit?` | Find memories by criteria |
| `hybrid_search` | `query`, `file_path?`, `tags?`, `limit?` | Semantic + keyword + scored search (best retrieval) |
| `embed_all` | — | Generate embeddings for all memories |
| `cleanup` | `dry_run?`, `min_relevance?`, `max_age_days?` | Dedupe + archive + decay (clustering is internal) |
| `add_rule` | `content`, `reason?` | Add permanent rule (never decays) |
| `list_rules` | — | Get all rules for project |
| `modify` | `memory_id`, `content?`, `relevance?`, `category?` | Edit a memory |

### `work` Tool

| Operation | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `log_mistake` | `description`, `file_path?`, `how_to_avoid?` | Record an error |
| `log_decision` | `decision`, `reason`, `alternatives?` | Record a choice |

### `scope` Tool

> The `loop` tool was removed in v0.8.0. Loop detection is hook-automatic: edits and test results are tracked in per-session hook state by the PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks, which warn on real spirals (repeat edits with failing tests). There is no agent-callable loop op.

### `context` Tool

Checkpoint and handoff are one unified ring buffer. `checkpoint_*` are the primary names; `handoff_*` are deprecated aliases kept for backward compatibility.

| Operation | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `checkpoint_save` | `task_description`, `current_step?`, `completed_steps?`, `pending_steps?`, `files_involved?`, `handoff_summary?`, `handoff_context_needed?`, `handoff_warnings?` | Save task state; emits HANDOFF.md when handoff content is present |
| `checkpoint_restore` | `index?`, `task_id?` | Restore a checkpoint: `index=0` latest, `index=N` older from history |
| `checkpoint_list` | — | List unified checkpoint/handoff history newest-first (index, age, kind, summary) |

| `check` | `project_path`, `code_or_filename` | Deterministic pattern check against stored conventions (no LLM) |
| `remove` | `project_path`, `rule` | Remove by matching text |

> The `output` tool (`validate_code` / `validate_result`) was removed in v0.8.0. Its inline checks are covered by `audit_batch`'s inline mode (`code` + `language`).

### Standalone Tools

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `scout_search` | `query`, `directory`, `max_results?` | Semantic codebase search (uses Ollama when available) |
| `file_summarize` | `file_path` | Structural summary (purpose, exports, dependencies, complexity) — pattern-based, no LLM |
| `deps_map` | `file_path` or `symbol`, `project_root?`, `include_reverse?` | Map a file's dependencies, or locate a symbol (file, signature, importers) via the code index |
| `impact_analyze` | `file_path`, `project_root`, `proposed_changes?` | Change impact analysis |
| `audit_batch` | `file_paths`+`min_severity?` (files) · or `code`+`language?` (inline) | Audit files or lint a snippet for AI-slop patterns — pure regex/AST, no LLM |
| `find_similar_issues` | `issue_pattern`, `project_path`, `file_extensions?`, `exclude_paths?` | Search for bug patterns — pure regex/AST, no LLM |

> `scout_analyze` was removed in v0.8.0 (zero recorded use — the agent reads code better than a 12B commentary pass).

### MCP Tool Annotations

All 16 MCP tools carry MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `idempotentHint`, `title`, `openWorldHint`). 8 read-only analysis tools (`claude_engram_status`, `pre_edit_check`, `scout_search`, `file_summarize`, `deps_map`, `impact_analyze`, `find_similar_issues`, `audit_batch`) are marked `readOnlyHint=true` and `idempotentHint=true`. Operation-enum tools that bundle reads and writes under one name (e.g. `memory`, `session_mine`, `scope`, `context`) are marked `readOnlyHint=false`. All tools are local (`openWorldHint=false`). MCP clients and Claude Code's permission system use these annotations to skip confirmation prompts on read-only calls.

### `session_mine` Tool

| Operation | Parameters | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `search` | `query`, `project_path`, `limit?`, `method?`, `since?`, `until?`, `kind?` | Semantic search across past conversations. `kind` filters by hit type: `decision`/`next-step`/`error`/`narration` — regex-classified, LLM-free. |
| `decisions` | `query`, `project_path` | Find when/why a decision was made, with context |
| `replay` | `file_path`, `project_path`, `limit?` | Find discussions about a specific file |
| `struggles` | `project_path` | Files/areas with repeated difficulty |
| `errors` | `project_path` | Recurring error patterns across sessions |
| `correlations` | `project_path` | Files frequently edited together |
| `timeline` | `project_path` | Project development timeline |
| `summaries` | `project_path` | Auto-generated session summaries |
| `overview` | `project_path` | High-level project stats |
| `status` | `project_path` | Mining index coverage |
| `reindex` | `project_path`, `mode?` | Trigger background re-indexing (post_session, bootstrap, full) |
| `predict` | `file_path`, `project_path` | Predict context needed for a file edit |
| `cross_project` | — | Patterns across all projects |
| `reflect` | `project_path` | Injection precision report: which context kinds (memory/prediction/precheck/blast) precede passing tests, plus LLM-synthesized insights from recurring mistakes/patterns |
| `commitments` | `project_path` | Reads the LIVE transcript (newest *.jsonl, picked by newest last-message timestamp) for open-loop items. Two channels: DEFERRED scans ~450 recent messages for next-session/remaining/TODO/follow-up/defer mentions; IN-FLIGHT scans last ~30 messages for "I'll"/"let me"/"next" actions. Heuristic, LLM-free. The post-session mining index cannot see the open session; this op fills that gap. Run before asking "what next?" or on session resume. |

## Changelog

### v0.8.13 — 2026-08-27

- **Fixed a real memory leak in the scorer daemon: ~0.73 MB per request, unbounded.** The daemon handles each connection on a fresh thread and ran the model call on that thread. PyTorch keeps per-thread state it does not release when the thread dies, so every request permanently retained ~0.73 MB. Measured dead-linear at **+146 MB per 200 requests across eight consecutive rounds with no plateau** — that is what walks a long-running daemon past 4 GB.
  - Isolated before fixing: `model.encode()` called 800× on the main thread is flat (1041.3 → 1041.4 MB); the same encode called once per fresh thread grows +0.73 MB each, matching the daemon exactly. Bare thread churn with no model call is flat, and thread/handle counts stayed constant throughout — so it was neither thread accumulation nor a socket/handle leak.
  - Every model call now runs on one long-lived pinned thread (`_on_model_thread`, a `max_workers=1` executor). That costs nothing: the GIL and torch serialized these calls already. After the fix the same workload is flat — 1043.0 → 1043.4 MB over 800 requests, committed bytes pinned at 2519 MB.
  - Measure committed/private bytes, not just working set, when checking this on Windows: Windows does not trim working sets without memory pressure, so working set alone can mislead in both directions. Both metrics grew here, which is what confirmed a true leak.
- **Bounded the VRAM spike.** The transient bulk worker encoded with `batch_size=256` against the encoder's full 512-token window — a multi-GB activation footprint. Measured on a 1500-text job with long inputs: **peak 8049 MiB at batch 256 vs 3147 MiB at batch 64**, against an 833 MiB idle baseline (7216 MiB → 2305 MiB of actual job footprint, a 3.1x cut). On a 12 GB card the old peak contends with anything else training. Batch is now 64 (`CLAUDE_ENGRAM_GPU_BATCH` to override). The spike itself is by design and not a leak — VRAM returned to 833–836 MiB after every run, because the worker exits and process exit is the only way to fully release a CUDA context.
- **Capped encoder input at `MAX_ENCODE_CHARS = 2000`, server-side.** The encoder discards anything past its 512-token window anyway, so oversized text was tokenized and padded at full cost and then thrown away, ratcheting the allocator's high-water mark. `embed_batch` truncated at the client; `embed` and the scorer's no-sentence-break fallback (a pasted log, code, one long line) did not. Applied in the daemon so every caller is covered. Two 20k-word blobs now cost +6 MB instead of hundreds.
- **The resident daemon's batch path was capped too.** The first pass capped only the transient bulk worker. The daemon's own `embed_batch` still used 256, which fires when `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DEVICE=cuda` puts it on the GPU — and there it is strictly worse than the case already fixed: the worker exits and releases its CUDA context, the daemon never does, so a 256-row batch parks multi-GB of activations for the life of the process. Both paths now share `gpu_batch_size()`, and `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_GPU_BATCH` is in the README config table rather than only the changelog.
- New `tests/bench_scorer_thread_affinity.py` (10 checks): model work never runs on the caller's thread, 40 concurrent caller threads share one model thread, results and exceptions propagate unchanged, and a source guard fails if any call site in `_handle_client` bypasses the pool — the leak returns silently the moment one does.

### v0.8.12 — 2026-08-03

- **Consolidation deleted the memories it merged.** `_consolidate_group_with_llm` kept the 5 highest-relevance originals and dropped the rest by reassigning `proj.entries` — nothing wrote them anywhere else, so they were gone for good. That contradicts the rule the rest of the store follows ("cleanup archives before deleting; nothing is lost without review"), and it was latent only because `consolidate` had no dispatch branch until v0.8.9 — wiring the operation is what made it reachable.
  - It bites hardest exactly where consolidation is most tempting: auto-captured decisions are all minted at the same relevance, so "keep the top 5 by relevance" degenerates to "keep whichever 5 come first". One `dry_run=false` call on the reference store's decision group would have destroyed roughly 200 memories with no way back.
  - Merged members now go through `_move_entries_to_archive` — the same restorable path everything else uses. The response and the tool description say so, and both now warn that a very large group compresses into one paragraph and loses the specifics worth recalling.
  - New `tests/bench_consolidate_safety.py` (7 checks): every dropped member lands in the archive, nothing evaporates (`hot_before == hot_after - digest + archived`), an archived member restores by id, the digest reaches the hot tier, and rules/mistakes are never consolidated. It uses a fake LLM client, so the safety property is pinned without needing Ollama.

### v0.8.11 — 2026-08-03

- **The hot tier could not shrink: two constants collided.** The miner mints auto-captured decisions with a hardcoded `relevance=7` (`extractors.py`, `work_tracker.py`), and `_is_archivable` exempted anything with `relevance >= 7`. Every auto-captured decision was therefore born permanently exempt from age-archiving. On the reference store that left **231 decisions untouched for over two weeks and still un-archivable**, with relevance taking exactly two values across all 444 (417 at 7, 27 at 6) — a constant, not a judgment.
  - The exemption is now `ARCHIVE_EXEMPT_RELEVANCE = 8`, a named constant documented as *"must stay above every default"*: manual `remember` is 5, auto-decisions are 7, rules are 9 and exempt by category anyway. It now means "someone marked this important" instead of "it exists". Injection scoring is untouched — relevance still carries its 15% weight, so what gets injected does not change.
  - This is the real cause of unbounded hot growth, not a missing consolidator. `cleanup` was correct to report zero: it removes near-duplicates (0.85 similarity — the same memory stored twice), which is a different job.
  - New `tests/bench_archive_exemption.py` (12 checks). Beyond the regression itself it pins the *property*: it parses the real mint sites with `ast` and fails if any age-eligible hardcoded relevance ever reaches the exemption again. Written with `ast` rather than regex because the two kwargs appear in either order, and a "nearest preceding `category=`" heuristic mis-attributed a call that passed `relevance` first.

### v0.8.10 — 2026-08-03

- **One name per concept on the ring record.** Every checkpoint written to the ring carried both vocabularies — the checkpoint one (`pending_steps`, `files_involved`, `handoff_warnings`, `handoff_context_needed`, `key_decisions`, `timestamp`) and the handoff one (`next_steps`, `files_in_progress`, `warnings`, `context_needed`, `decisions`, `created`). Audited before changing anything: across the 129 stored records carrying both, all six pairs were identical in **every single record**. The checkpoint twin is no longer written.
  - **`task_description` / `summary` is not a twin pair and was left alone.** `summary` is the handoff note (`handoff_summary or task_description`) and differed from the task title in **110 of those 129 records** — collapsing it would have merged "what the task is" with "where things stand" and lost one.
  - **No migration.** Records on disk keep both names and every reader accepts either. Two readers did *not*: the SessionStart banner checked only `pending_steps` and `checkpoint_restore` checked only `key_decisions`, both with no fallback — so a handoff-shaped record (written by `create_handoff`, which only ever emits the handoff vocabulary) silently lost its "Pending: N steps" and "Key decisions: N recorded" lines. Both fixed here.
  - A side effect worth naming: `checkpoint_restore` passes the whole record as `data`, and `to_formatted_string` renders every list in it — so a dual-vocabulary record printed **each list twice**, once per name. The collapse removes the repeat without losing a line.
  - New `tests/bench_ring_vocabulary.py` (19 checks): canonical name written and twin absent, `task_description`/`summary` both surviving with different values, a collapsed record rendering the same as a legacy one through both the banner and restore, and a handoff-shaped record rendering every line.

### v0.8.9 — 2026-08-03

- **`memory(consolidate)` and `memory(clusters)` were unreachable.** Both were fully implemented (LLM tag-group consolidation with a 10-entry floor, rules and mistakes exempt; cluster listing) and both were named in the tool's own "Use: …" error string as valid operations — but neither appeared in the MCP schema `enum`, and neither had a dispatch branch. So they could not be called at all, while the error you got for trying said they were valid. Now wired, schema'd, and documented.
  - This is why a store could reach hundreds of hot decisions while `cleanup` honestly reported nothing to merge: cleanup removes **near-duplicates** (Jaccard and cosine at 0.85 — the same memory stored twice), which is a different job from compressing a topic. On the reference store, `consolidate` immediately found 4 groups worth merging, one of them 402 memories.
  - Both responses pass a compact `data` payload. `to_formatted_string` renders a list-of-dicts as memory entries (`id`/`content`/`tags`), so handing it the raw report printed `[] () {'tag': …}` per group — the same double-render trap `hybrid_search` documents.

### v0.8.8 — 2026-08-03

- **Fix: a project-scoped restore could silently return stale state.** `_handoff_candidate_dirs` resolved a project's own ring plus its ANCESTORS, never its descendants — so a `checkpoint_restore` at a workspace root could only read the root ring while the session's real final checkpoint sat in a sub-project ring. Because the root ring is rarely empty, the call returned an hours-old entry **and reported success**. Observed live: a root-scoped restore returned an 11.8h checkpoint while the actual 9.7h one sat in the sub-project's ring. A query now sees every ring at or beneath the path it asked about. Siblings still can't leak in (that is what kept the cross-project global ring a fallback rather than an always-on candidate), and ordering doesn't decide the winner — the newest deliberate checkpoint does.
- **Restores and saves now say which store they used.** `checkpoint_restore` prints `**From:** <project> · <age>h` and warns when the winning entry belongs to a different sub-project than the one asked from; `checkpoint_save` reports the ring it filed under, calling out the global fallback for unregistered projects. A confident payload with no origin let a cross-project or stale restore pass for "yours".
- **`claude_engram_status` no longer fails wholesale when Ollama is down.** It reported `FAILED` with "cannot function without a working Ollama connection" while storage, checkpoints, hooks, injection scoring, the code index, precheck and blast-radius were all working — every one of them LLM-free. Status is now per-capability, and names the three operations that actually degrade (`scout_search`, `memory(consolidate)`, `session_mine(reflect)` synthesis). A health check that cries wolf gets ignored on the day it is right.
- **`memory(embed_all)` distinguishes its two zero cases.** "All memories already embedded (or scorer server not running)" was returned identically whether there was nothing to do or the scorer was dead. It now reports the actual pending count and says plainly when the scorer is unreachable.
- **Mined fixes reject narration.** The fix for a recurring error was taken from the first sentence of the next assistant message, so a real stored fix read `"Let me check the correct path:"` — an intention, replayed later as if it were guidance. Extraction now scans the next few assistant messages for a sentence that states a resolution, and the pattern reader filters legacy records the same way, so no migration is needed.
- **Dropped `progress_percent` from checkpoint saves.** Each save re-derives its step lists, so the number fell (56% → 42%) across a productive night as the remaining work came into focus. Raw done/remaining counts replace it.
- **Two silent-feature-loss bugs.** Pattern injection joined a path on a possibly-`None` project dir, and the pre-edit import check read an unbound `data` when stdin was empty — both raised into an enclosing `except`, so the features simply never ran for those cases instead of reporting anything.
- **`MiniClaudeResponse` → `EngramResponse`** (131 references). The class is never serialized, so this is internal only.
- **Type-check clean:** 98 package errors → 0, mostly by typing the `subprocess` kwargs dicts that made Pyright re-check every parameter as `int`. Includes a real annotation bug (`tuple[list[str], any]` used the builtin `any` instead of `typing.Any`) and `None` defaults on parameters declared non-optional.

### v0.8.7 — 2026-07-26

- **Removed: session titling from restored checkpoints** (shipped in 0.8.6). SessionStart fires on resume and post-compact too, so the title stomped names the user set with `/rename`; and in a multi-project workspace the restored checkpoint can belong to a *different* sub-project than the session — an engram session came back titled `sabir: …`. The session name belongs to Claude Code and the user; engram never writes it back. `bench_session_identity` now pins the inverse invariant: `session_start_json` emits no `sessionTitle` for any checkpoint kind (10 checks, was 18).

### v0.8.6 — 2026-07-26

- **Fix: MCP tools read the live session's state, not a stale one.** Working state lives in `sessions/<session_id>.json`. Hooks learn that id from their stdin payload, but the MCP server has no stdin, so it fell through to the shared `hook_state.json` — a file the per-session hooks never write. `session_end()` therefore reported whatever was last left in that file: on the reference store, a session that had started 15 days earlier with 0 files edited. Claude Code 2.1.154+ exports `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` to stdio MCP servers, so the server now adopts it at startup and MCP-side reads line up with hook-side writes.
  - Deliberately scoped to the MCP server rather than folded into `get_state_file()`: the scorer daemon serves many sessions from one long-lived process and clears the id between requests, so an ambient environment fallback there would resurrect exactly the cross-session leak that reset prevents. Only a process that maps 1:1 to a session opts in.
  - Adoption never overrides an id already parsed from stdin — per-call truth beats a process-level variable that outlives any one payload.
- **Session title from a restored checkpoint** (Claude Code 2.1.152+). Resuming a **manual** checkpoint sets `hookSpecificOutput.sessionTitle`, so the row in `claude agents` reads `myproj: Migrating auth to OAuth2` instead of a generic title. Autos never title — the same deliberate-beats-automatic rule the teaser follows, so "Session stopped. 2 files edited." can never overwrite a name you chose.
- **`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` as the MCP last resort.** Two MCP paths (`deps_map` symbol lookup, `session_end`) fell back to the server process's cwd — which is wherever Claude Code happened to spawn it, not your project. Both now defer to `get_project_dir()`, which prefers `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (now exported to stdio MCP servers).
- **Docs:** a large `session_mine(reindex, mode="bootstrap")` can exceed Claude Code's 2-minute MCP call limit and auto-continue in the background; re-run the query once it settles rather than re-triggering the rebuild.
- New `tests/bench_session_identity.py` (18 checks): identity precedence (stdin > env > shared fallback), the `session_end` regression against a stale-vs-live store, title selection, and the real SessionStart hook subprocess asserting a valid schema with the title set for manuals and absent for autos.

### v0.8.5 — 2026-06-30

- **Checkpoint-injection fix.** The SessionStart `CHECKPOINT` teaser could surface a trivial per-turn auto ("Session stopped. 2 files edited.") while the substantive manual handoff sat correctly at ring index 0 — the two selectors were identical but read *different rings*: auto handoffs targeted the cwd (workspace root) ring, manual saves the sub-project ring, and the candidate walk only ascends. Six coordinated changes:
  1. **The history ring is deliberate-checkpoints-only.** Autos contend only for the latest pointer; they never append (Stop fires every turn — per-turn autos evicted real checkpoints from the 20-slot FIFO within one session). Newest auto stays restorable via the pointer fold-in; legacy single-slot seeding preserved on every write.
  2. **Teaser resolution by session source.** Resume → resolve the project from THIS session's own edited files (captured before the per-session reset; concurrency-safe, never the pooled "last session"). Fresh → newest MANUAL across the workspace subtree as a labeled breadcrumb, else the plain walk-up.
  3. **Stop + pre-compact autos write to the file-resolved project ring** (majority vote over recent edits), not the cwd.
  4. **Manuals exempt from the 48h teaser cutoff** (14 days; autos keep 48h) — a weekend away no longer silently expires the handoff you wrote for yourself.
  5. **Self-identifying teaser label**: kind + sub-project + task_id (`CHECKPOINT [manual, 2.1h ago, grommet, task_…]`) so the model can restore exactly what was teased.
  6. **Subagent stop guard**: a Stop carrying `agent_id` doesn't write the parent's ring.
- **Fix: `get_state_file` honors `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DIR`** — the last storage path hardcoded to `~/.claude_engram`, which broke the documented test-isolation seam for per-session hook state.
- `bench_handoff_durability` updated to the new ring contract (autos pointer-only; second manual at index 1; auto-only fallback via pointer).

### v0.8.4 — 2026-06-11

- **Curated-lessons bridge (opt-in).** Dated entries (`YYYY-MM-DD — insight`) in user-curated note files sync as protected `lesson` memories — never archived, decayed, or deduped (the file owns the lifecycle: edits update, removals retire), +0.25 injection bonus, and code-index-joined triggers: a lesson naming a module gains `related_files` = the files importing it, so it surfaces exactly when that code is touched. Strictly opt-in via `config.json` `lessons_globs` (e.g. `["docs/lessons/*.md"]`); the tool ships no default path and never guesses which markdown is a lessons file.
- **Pattern banner is project-scoped and recency-decayed.** Recurring errors carry `projects` (attributed from the contributing sessions' edited files) and `last_seen`; the session-start banner filters to the sub-projects the last session touched, and errors quiet for 30 days drop out of the report entirely. Struggles are scoped by their (now full) paths.
- **Struggles metric made causal.** Full-path keys (no more basename pooling across projects) and `errors_nearby` counts only sessions where an extracted mistake actually references the file (via `related_files` or a traceback mention). Files with zero attributable errors are not struggles.
- **TDD-aware mistake capture.** Failing test invocations (`pytest`, `npm test`, `python tests/...`, suite-marker outputs) are tracked as test FAILs but never auto-logged as mistakes — RED-phase failures are deliberate. Shared `_is_test_invocation()` across both bash handlers.
- **Migration `0.8.4:modernize_mistake_store`** (automatic on next SessionStart / install): legacy in-place `archived_at` flags move into archive.json for real, and machine-written mistakes provably fixed against the current code index (missing module now resolves, missing attribute now exists on that class) are archived. Never deletes; never touches manual `log_mistake` entries.
- **Stale-mistake hygiene now covers `session_mining`.** The 0.8.1 gate only matched `auto-detected` — 18 of 282 mistakes on the reference store; the transcript miner stamps `session_mining`. Both are machine-written. Live effect with the migration: 282 → 71 hot mistakes, all restorable.
- **Decision capture stores full sentences** (word-boundary cut at 300; banner display word-boundary at 200) instead of a hard 150-char slice mid-word.
- **Honest activity counts.** New `prompt_count` (real typed prompts) alongside `user_message_count` (every type=user line, incl. tool results — semantics preserved for the re-mine watermarks). The banner now reads "N prompts" / "N tool errors".
- **Rule banners deduped against CLAUDE.md.** A rule whose significant words are ≥70% covered by the project's CLAUDE.md is suppressed from session-start/post-compact display (still enforced, still listable) — ends the triple CLAUDE.md / rules / MEMORY.md injection.
- **Fix: Windows memory-embeddings save.** `embed_all_memories` kept the loader's live mmap of embeddings.npy while saving to the same path — Errno 22, silently freezing memory-embedding updates on Windows. Handle dropped after copying rows.

### v0.8.3 — 2026-06-11

- **GPU policy split — cpu-resident daemon, transient GPU worker.** The v0.8.2 resident-GPU default parked model weights plus a CUDA context (~1GB VRAM) for the daemon's entire lifetime, and live-mining ticks keep the daemon warm all day — indistinguishable from a VRAM leak in practice. Device policy is now: resident consumers (scorer daemon, in-process fallbacks) always load on cpu; bulk embedding jobs of `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_GPU_BULK_MIN`+ texts (default 512 — bootstrap re-embeds, model-change rebuilds, store sweeps) run in `claude_engram.embed_worker`, a short-lived process that loads on cuda, encodes one job, writes `.npy`, and exits. Process exit fully releases the CUDA context — the GPU is borrowed for seconds, never parked. The worker declines (and the caller falls back to the daemon) when no GPU exists. `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DEVICE` remains a global override in both directions. Measured: cuda/cpu vectors identical at cos 1.000000, so device changes never rebuild stores; daemon RSS 1.2GB (cuda) → 680MB (cpu), VRAM 0.
- **In-process fallback model cached.** The daemon-down fallback in `score_decision_semantic` loaded a fresh model per call; now one cached load per process, on cpu.
- **Single-instance daemon startup.** `serve()` exits immediately when a live, signature-matching server already owns `PORT_FILE`, closing the two-session spawn race that left an orphan daemon holding a loaded model for up to 30 minutes.

### v0.8.2 — 2026-06-11

- **GPU embeddings, auto-detected.** `load_sentence_transformer()` resolves the device once: `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DEVICE` override, else `cuda` when a CUDA-enabled torch is present, else cpu — and a broken CUDA runtime degrades to cpu instead of killing the scorer. The device is deliberately not part of the embedding signature (cuda and cpu produce identical vectors), so switching devices never rebuilds stores. `embed_batch` runs batch 256 on GPU / 64 on CPU; the scorer writes a `scorer_device` breadcrumb that `claude_engram_status` reports.
- **Live mining ticks — engram stays fresh during the session.** The Stop hook fires a debounced (`CLAUDE_ENGRAM_LIVE_MINE`, default 300s) background mine in the new `live` mode: session index, extraction, search embeddings, and the two most-recent code indexes — every phase cursor/watermark-incremental, so each tick costs only the new transcript tail. Cross-session search and `replay`/`predict` now see the running session's earlier turns; previously everything waited for SessionEnd.
- **Decision-gate retune for bge-base.** `AMBIGUITY_MARGIN` 0.05 → 0.025 (the old value was tuned on MiniLM): semantic F1 72.7% → 76.9%, combined 77.4% → 79.0% on the 220-prompt bench. Recall +10.8 for precision -3.8 — lost decisions are unrecoverable, noise captures get deduped, so the recall side wins. `DECISION_THRESHOLD` measured as a dead knob below 0.575 (the `score >= 0.45` capture cutoff already implies sim >= 0.525) and left at 0.45.

### v0.8.1 — 2026-06-11

- **Error deja-vu at failure time.** PostToolUseFailure now matches the fresh error against mined recurring errors (`patterns.json`) and the hot mistake store, and injects the past fix inline: `Deja vu: TypeError hit in 3 past session(s) - fix: ...`. Template matching reuses the miner's signature normalization, guarded by quoted-identifier overlap (an unrelated class never inherits someone else's fix); class-less failures (Edit conflicts, CLI errors) match manual mistakes by word overlap. Runs before auto-log so it can't match itself.
- **Symbol lookup via `deps_map(symbol="X")`.** Answers "where is X defined?" from the background code index: defining file, signature (`__init__` + method list for classes), dotted module, and reverse-import blast radius. Typo-tolerant (closest-name suggestion). No grep, no LLM, no build.
- **Sub-project code indexes no longer go stale.** The miner only built the mined project's index, and the workspace walk prunes nested project dirs — in workspace setups, sub-project indexes (read by precheck, blast-radius, read-context, and the new symbol lookup) silently froze. Miner phase 6 now also refreshes every sub-project edited in the last ~10 sessions (incremental, mtime-keyed, cheap).
- **Mistake hygiene.** Auto-captured mistakes that never recurred — 3+ weeks old, signature absent from mined recurring errors, no overlap with recently-edited files — are moved to the archive by miner phase 5. Manual `log_mistake` entries and rules are never touched. Archived mistakes stay searchable (`archive_search`) and restorable (`restore`).
- **Fix: `archived_at` is now honored by hook readers.** `acknowledge_mistake` set the flag but hot readers and banner counters never filtered it, so acknowledged mistakes kept appearing in pre-edit warnings. Hook readers now skip archived entries, and `acknowledge_mistake` performs a real move into `archive.json` (restorable) instead of an in-place flag.
- **Known-good test commands.** Test invocations the bash hooks already classify as test runs are tracked per project with pass/fail counts (`test_commands.json`, capped at 30). Session start surfaces the top currently-passing commands. Inline `python -c`, heredocs, `.scratch` scripts, and 160+ char contraptions are never recorded; a command whose latest run failed drops out until it passes again.

### v0.8.0 — 2026-06-10

- **Tool surface trimmed (19 → 16).** Removed `loop` (loop detection is hook-automatic and per-session now), `output` (its `validate_code`/`validate_result` checks are covered by `audit_batch`'s inline mode), and `scout_analyze` (zero recorded use). The remaining 16: `claude_engram_status`, `session_start`, `session_end`, `pre_edit_check`, `memory`, `work`, `scope`, `context`, `convention`, `scout_search`, `file_summarize`, `deps_map`, `impact_analyze`, `find_similar_issues`, `audit_batch`, `session_mine`.
- **LLM role narrowed — Ollama is now an optional flavor.** It is used only by `memory(consolidate)` and `session_mine(reflect)` insight synthesis (both background, both degrade silently without it), plus `scout_search` when available. Everything proactive — hooks, code index, precheck, blast-radius, injection scoring — is LLM-free.
- **`convention(check)` is now a deterministic pattern check** against stored conventions (the LLM mode was removed: its "no check-mark means violation" heuristic was a false-positive machine with zero recorded use).
- **`file_summarize` is structural only** — the `mode` parameter and the LLM "detailed" mode are gone. It returns purpose, exports, dependencies, and a complexity estimate from pattern/structure analysis.
- **`audit_batch` and `find_similar_issues` are pure regex/AST** — no LLM, no network (they never were; the docs are now explicit).
- **Loop-detection state is per-session.** Edit counts and test results live in the session's hook state (`sessions/<sid>.json`), not the shared `~/.claude_engram/loop_detector.json` — two concurrent sessions no longer cross-contaminate. The old `loop_detector.json` is abandoned (harmless if present).
- **Pre-edit no longer records file edits** (only post-edit does), so denied or failed edits aren't counted toward the loop threshold.
- **Session-mining merge + per-phase error isolation.** A session that grows after being indexed (PreCompact then SessionEnd) now MERGES counts instead of resetting them; each miner phase is error-isolated and `mining_status.json` records which phase failed (`phase_errors`).
- **Auto-logged mistakes/decisions in a brand-new project are no longer dropped** — the project is auto-registered in the manifest first.
- **New env var `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DIR`** overrides the storage location (default `~/.claude_engram`) and is the supported test-isolation seam.
- **`memory(embed_all)` fixed** — it crashed with a `NameError` since the args rename; it now reads its `force` flag from the call args.
- **Pre-edit hook ~2x faster** (~400ms → ~220ms median): stdlib-only `hooks/hot_reader.py` scoring path, lazy `tools/__init__`, one `memory.json` parse per hook, banner dedup.
- **Configurable embedding model** via `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_EMBED_MODEL` / `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_EMBED_DIM` (or `config.json`). Every embedding store is signature-stamped (`model@dim`) and rebuilds on model change; unstamped legacy stores read as the pinned `LEGACY_SIGNATURE` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2@native`).
- **Default encoder is `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`** — ungated (no HF account/token; `embeddinggemma` was evaluated and reverted: license-gated, ~3.3GB scorer RSS). Decision-capture semantic F1 at shipped thresholds: MiniLM 37.7% → bge-base 72.7%; live combined capture 77.4%. MiniLM remains the one-line ~90MB lightweight option.
- **Session-search embeddings are sharded by month** (`session_embeddings/<YYYY-MM>.npy`) instead of one ever-growing matrix fully rewritten at every session end; v1 stores migrate automatically. Optional `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS` prunes old months.
- **Append-aware re-mining.** Sessions that grow after indexing contribute their new tail to search embeddings (per-file watermarks) and are re-extracted for decisions/mistakes — previously they were skipped as already-seen.
- **JSONL schema canary.** The miner tracks what fraction of session-log lines it recognizes; a collapse vs the historical baseline warns at session start instead of degrading mining silently.
- **Hook daemon.** The scorer server doubles as a warm hook dispatcher; high-frequency hooks are thin `python -S` clients (one TCP round trip, in-daemon ~15-25ms, full in-process fallback). Heaviest hook measured 313ms → 216ms median on Windows; Linux gains more.
- **Proactive recall before Read** — `<engram-read-context>` with code-index orientation + the file's most relevant memories, once per file per session. Optional `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_LAST_FILE_PATH` statusline mirror.
- **Outcome feedback loop closed.** Per-kind injection pass-rate lift becomes a bounded (0.8-1.2x) multiplier on the memory-injection relevance gate (miner-computed `injection_weights.json`).
- **Isolated-storage daemons.** `scorer_port`/`scorer_pid`/`scorer_model` and the decision-template cache honor `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DIR`.
- **MCP launch hardening** — `install.py` points `.mcp.json` straight at the venv python instead of the `.bat` wrapper.
- **No emojis in any output.**

### v0.7.1 — 2026-06-02

- **Fix: `checkpoint_restore` / `checkpoint_list` could seat a stale checkpoint at index 0.** A sub-project query (e.g. `myproject/service-c`) walks up to ancestor rings; `read_latest` returned the *first* candidate ring's `latest_handoff.json` regardless of age, so a weeks-old handoff could occupy index 0 while the genuine latest sat lower — an autonomous resume trusting index 0 could act on the wrong plan. Restore now selects the newest **deliberate (manual)** checkpoint across the resolved scope: a newer manual outranks an older one (kills the stale win), and a routine auto session-stop never buries a deliberate checkpoint; it falls back to newest-of-any-kind only when no manual is in scope. `read_history` now folds each ring's `latest` pointer into the merged view (a legacy single-slot handoff is never missed), and `read_ordered` pins this corrected latest at index 0, so `checkpoint_restore index=0` == `checkpoint_list[0]` == `get_by_index(0)`. Read-path only — no migration; existing rings are re-interpreted correctly. New regression test: `tests/bench_restore_recency_scope.py`.

### v0.7.0 — 2026-06-01

- **`session_mine(commitments)`** — reads the LIVE session transcript (newest *.jsonl, picked by newest last-message timestamp) for open-loop items the post-session mining index cannot see. DEFERRED channel scans ~450 recent messages for next-session/remaining/TODO/follow-up/defer language; IN-FLIGHT channel scans last ~30 messages for "I'll"/"let me"/"next" actions. Heuristic, LLM-free.
- **Typed search (`session_mine(search, kind=...)`)** — every search hit is now classified by kind (`decision`/`next-step`/`error`/`narration`) using regex, no LLM. Pass `kind` to filter results to one type.
- **MCP tool annotations** — all 19 MCP tools carry `readOnlyHint`/`idempotentHint`/`title`/`openWorldHint` annotations. 10 read-only analysis tools are marked read-only + idempotent; write-capable tools are marked accordingly; all are local (`openWorldHint=false`). Allows MCP clients and Claude Code's permission system to skip prompts on read-only calls.
- **Consolidation hardening + re-date/down-rank migration** — memory consolidation is more conservative; a background migration re-dates and down-ranks over-promoted entries produced by prior aggressive runs.
- **Memory age at injection** — pre-edit hook output now shows each injected memory's age alongside its score, so Claude can weight stale memories appropriately.
- **Per-project HANDOFF.md + `checkpoint_list` scoping** — `checkpoint_save` writes HANDOFF.md to the project directory (not only global checkpoints/); `checkpoint_list` is scoped to the active project and hides entries older than 7 days by default.

### v0.5.0 — 2026-05-28

- **Durable session handoffs** — replaces the single overwritable `latest_handoff.json` slot with a capped ring buffer (`handoff_history.json`, last 20)
  - Promotion guard: a trivial auto-handoff (no files edited, no decisions) never overwrites a substantive or manual handoff; manual handoffs always win
  - `kind: manual|auto` marker on every handoff
  - Walk-up read resolution: nearest project first, ancestors next, global slot last — a sub-project's handoff is no longer shadowed by the shared global slot
  - New `handoff_list` operation + `index` parameter on `handoff_get` to list and retrieve older handoffs (index 0 = latest, then newest-first)
  - The three handoff writers (`create_handoff`, Stop hook, PreCompact hook) now share one `handoff_store` module
  - Backward compatible: `latest_handoff.json` is kept in sync; an existing slot is seeded into history on first write (old/downgraded clients keep working)
- **Path-aware mistake relevance** — a shared basename across diverging paths (e.g. `service-a/.../__init__.py` vs `service-b/.../__init__.py`) is no longer treated as a match; generic basenames (`__init__.py`, `index.js`, …) require a full-path signal. Stops cross-version/cross-project mistakes firing on unrelated edits while preserving real matches
- **Actionable recurring errors** — pattern detection groups by a normalized signature (exception class + message with names/paths/numbers templated) instead of the bare exception class. `patterns.json` refreshes on the next mining pass
- **Fixes** — empty `<engram-error></engram-error>` tag suppressed; `last_message_preview` dropped from handoffs; `handoff_get` no longer prints the summary twice; `checkpoint_list` hides checkpoints older than 7 days (opt-in prune)
- **`extract_file_refs` fix** — it used a *capturing* group, so `re.findall` returned only the extension and silently dropped every path, storing basenames only. This was the root data cause of cross-version false positives (`related_files` never carried directory context). Now captures full/relative paths
- **Automatic, idempotent migrations** — on upgrade a version-stamped migration (run from the SessionStart hook and `install.py`, tracked in `manifest.migrations_applied`) seeds handoff history from the old single-slot file and, off the hook hot path, re-extracts `related_files` to full paths for existing memories. Forward-only, safe to re-run, downgrade-safe, no re-mine
- **Versioning** — `pyproject` version corrected (had lagged at 0.2.0 through the 0.3.x–0.4.x feature work)
- New benchmarks: `bench_handoff_durability.py`, `bench_path_relevance.py`

### v0.4.0 — 2026-04-08

- **Session mining platform** — automatically mines Claude Code session JSONL logs for intelligence
  - JSONL parser with streaming reader, path resolution, content extractors
  - Incremental session index with byte-offset cursors (8ms read, 1.5s full build for 330MB)

  - Predictive context: related files + likely errors auto-injected before edits
  - Cross-project learning: aggregate patterns across all projects
  - Retroactive bootstrap: auto-mines existing session history on first use
- **Batch embedding protocol** — `embed_batch` in scorer server, 22x faster than individual calls
- **`session_mine` MCP tool** — 13 operations (search, decisions, replay, predict, cross_project, etc.)
- **`/engram` skill** — slash command installed to `~/.claude/commands/`
