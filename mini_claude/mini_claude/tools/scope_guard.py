"""
Change Scope Guard - Prevent over-refactoring and unintended changes

The problem: User asks me to fix ONE thing, and I end up rewriting 5 files.
This "scope creep" breaks working code and frustrates users.

The solution: Explicitly declare which files are "in scope" for the current task.
Warn (loudly) if I try to edit files outside the declared scope.
