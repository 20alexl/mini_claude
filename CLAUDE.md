# Claude Engram - Persistent Memory for Claude Code

## How It Works

Claude Engram intercepts your tool calls via Claude Code hooks and automatically tracks what you do. Most features require zero invocations - they fire through hooks on every edit, bash command, error, and session event.

You also have MCP tools for things that need semantic judgment (saving discoveries, declaring rules, managing archives).

## What's Fully Automatic

These happen via hooks. You don't call anything:

| What | When It Fires | What You See |
|---|---|---|
| **Session restore** | SessionStart hook | Rules, mistakes, checkpoint, handoff |
| **Edit tracking** | PostToolUse Edit/Write | "Edit tracked: file.py (edit #3)" |
| **Loop warnings** | PreToolUse Edit/Write | Warning when same file edited 3+ times (state lives in per-session hook state, so concurrent sessions don't cross-contaminate) |
| **Scored memory injection** | PreToolUse Edit/Write | Top 3 relevant memories for the file |
| **Test tracking** | PostToolUse Bash | "PASS/FAIL Test tracked" |
| **Error auto-logging** | PostToolUseFailure (all tools) | Mistakes auto-saved from any failed tool |
| **Decision capture** | UserPromptSubmit | "let's use X" parsed via semantic + regex scoring |
| **Checkpoint on compact** | PreCompact | Task state saved before context compaction |
| **Context re-injection** | PostCompact | Rules + mistakes + decisions re-injected |
| **Session handoff on stop** | Stop | Saves last_assistant_message + files for next session |
| **Session summary on end** | SessionEnd | Files edited, memory counts |
| **Search spiral detection** | PostToolUse Bash | Warns after 3+ failed search commands |
| **Memory archiving** | cleanup / session_start | Old inactive memories archived, not deleted |
| **Sub-project scoping** | PreToolUse / PostToolUse | Memories scoped to the right sub-project |
| **Data migrations** | SessionStart (upgrade) | Cheap inline check; full migration in background |
| **Pre-edit import check** | PreToolUse Edit/Write | `<engram-precheck>` when a proposed import won't resolve against the code index (closest-name suggestion) |
| **Blast-radius alert** | PreToolUse Edit/Write | `<engram-blast-radius>` listing modules that import the file being edited |
| **Outcome feedback loop** | PreToolUse + PostToolUse Bash | Injection kinds correlated with test pass/fail; surfaced via `session_mine(reflect)` |
| **Schema canary** | SessionStart | Warning when Claude Code's log format stops being recognized (mining would otherwise degrade silently) |
| **Read context** | PreToolUse Read | `<engram-read-context>`: code-index orientation + the file's most relevant memories, once per file per session |
| **Error deja-vu** | PostToolUseFailure | "Deja vu: TypeError hit in 3 past session(s) - fix: ..." when a fresh failure matches a mined recurring error or stored mistake (identifier-guarded, so an unrelated class never inherits someone else's fix) |
| **Known-good test commands** | SessionStart | The project's top tracked test commands that currently pass — verification starts from what worked, not a guess |
| **Mistake hygiene** | Background miner | Stale auto-captured one-off mistakes (3+ weeks, never recurred, away from current work) move to the archive — banners keep their signal; restorable via `memory(restore)` |
| **Live mining tick** | Stop (per turn, debounced) | Session index, extractions, search embeddings, and the active code indexes refresh DURING the session — `session_mine(search)` sees this session's earlier work, not just past sessions. Interval `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_LIVE_MINE` (default 300s) |
| **Curated-lessons bridge** | Background miner (opt-in) | Dated entries in lesson files sync as protected `lesson` memories with code-index-joined triggers — a lesson mentioning a module surfaces when editing files that import it. The file stays the source of truth (edits update, removals retire). Off unless `lessons_globs` is set in `~/.claude_engram/config.json` (e.g. `["docs/lessons/*.md"]`) — no default path |
| **Project-scoped patterns** | SessionStart | Recurring errors/struggles are attributed to sub-projects and filtered by what the last session touched — a vzip session no longer sees CORTEX errors. Errors unseen for 30 days drop out |

## Multi-Project Workspaces

When run from a workspace root containing multiple projects, memories are automatically scoped to the right sub-project based on which file is being edited. Project boundaries are detected by looking for markers like `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `.git`, or `CLAUDE.md`.

Rules and mistakes from the workspace root are inherited by all sub-projects. You don't need to configure anything.

## When To Use Tools

### Use When Helpful

- `memory(remember)` - Save an important discovery about the codebase.
- `memory(add_rule)` - Add a permanent rule (e.g., "always use strict TypeScript").
- `work(log_decision)` - Log an important architectural choice with reasoning.
- `work(log_mistake)` - Log a complex mistake the auto-detection missed.
- `impact_analyze` - Before refactoring shared files.
- `scout_search` - Semantic codebase search when grep isn't enough.
- `deps_map(symbol="X")` - "Where is X defined?" from the code index: file, signature, importers. Cheaper than a grep + read when you know the name but not its home.

### Advanced (Optional)

- `scope(declare)` - Set explicit file boundaries for a complex task.
- `context(checkpoint_save)` - Manual checkpoint for very long tasks.
- `memory(archive)` - Review and archive old memories.

### You Almost Never Need

- `session_start` - SessionStart hook auto-starts. Only call for deep context load.
- `session_end` - Stop + SessionEnd hooks handle teardown. Just a summary view.
- `pre_edit_check` - PreToolUse hook auto-runs this. Only call manually for impact analysis.

## Quick Reference

### Memory Operations

```python
# Store
memory(operation="remember", content="Important fact", project_path="/path")
memory(operation="add_rule", content="Always do X", reason="Because Y", project_path="/path")

# Find
memory(operation="search", query="auth", project_path="/path")
memory(operation="recent", project_path="/path", limit=10)

# Mistakes
memory(operation="list_mistakes", project_path="/path")                  # View all with IDs
memory(operation="acknowledge_mistake", memory_id="abc123", project_path="/path")  # Archive learned mistake

# Manage (IDs shown in [brackets] at session start and in hook output)
memory(operation="modify", memory_id="abc123", content="Updated", project_path="/path")
memory(operation="delete", memory_id="abc123", project_path="/path")
memory(operation="promote", memory_id="abc123", reason="Important", project_path="/path")
memory(operation="batch_delete", category="context", project_path="/path")

# Cleanup & Archive
memory(operation="cleanup", dry_run=True, project_path="/path")      # Preview: near-dupe removal + decay + archive
memory(operation="consolidate", dry_run=True, project_path="/path")  # Preview: merge a tag group into one digest (LLM)
memory(operation="consolidate", tag="decision", dry_run=False, project_path="/path")
memory(operation="clusters", project_path="/path")                    # List clusters (cluster_id expands one)
memory(operation="archive", dry_run=True, project_path="/path")       # Preview: move old to cold
memory(operation="archive_search", query="auth", project_path="/path") # Search cold tier
memory(operation="restore", memory_id="abc123", project_path="/path") # Bring back from archive
memory(operation="archive_status", project_path="/path")              # Hot vs archive counts
```

### Work Tracking

```python
work(operation="log_mistake", description="What broke", how_to_avoid="How to prevent")
work(operation="log_decision", decision="What you chose", reason="Why", alternatives=["Other options"])
```

### Context Protection

```python
# Checkpoint — save task state before compaction or session end
context(
    operation="checkpoint_save",
    task_description="Migrating auth to OAuth2",
    current_step="Step 3: token refresh",
    completed_steps=["Step 1: added provider config", "Step 2: login flow"],
    pending_steps=["Step 3: token refresh", "Step 4: tests"],
    files_involved=["auth.py", "oauth.py"],
    project_path="/path/to/project"
)

# Restore last checkpoint
context(operation="checkpoint_restore")

# Bridge to next session: checkpoint_save also carries handoff fields
# (handoff_create/get/list remain as deprecated aliases)
context(
    operation="checkpoint_save",
    task_description="OAuth2 migration",
    pending_steps=["Implement refresh_token()", "Add integration tests"],
    handoff_summary="OAuth2 migration 60% done, token refresh next",
    handoff_context_needed=["OAuth provider docs at docs/oauth.md"],
    handoff_warnings=["Don't touch legacy auth.py — still used by mobile"],
    project_path="/path/to/project"
)

# Restore an older entry from the ring (index=N; 0 = latest)
context(operation="checkpoint_restore", project_path="/path/to/project", index=1)

# Browse history newest-first (index, age, kind, summary)
context(operation="checkpoint_list", project_path="/path/to/project")

# Verify completion
context(operation="verify_completion", task="OAuth2 migration", verification_steps=["All tests pass", "Login flow works"])
```

## Memory System

### Categories

| Category | Purpose | Protected | Auto-captured |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rule` | Project rules that always apply | Never archived or decayed | No - manual |
| `lesson` | Curated insights synced from lesson files | Never archived or decayed; the source file owns the lifecycle | Opt-in - miner syncs the globs in `lessons_globs` |
| `mistake` | Errors to avoid repeating | Manual ones never archive; stale machine-written one-offs auto-archive, and provably-fixed ones archive via migration (all restorable) | Yes - from failed tools + transcript mining |
| `decision` | Choices and reasoning | No | Yes - from user prompts |
| `discovery` | Facts learned about the codebase | No | No - manual |
| `context` | Session-specific notes | No | No - manual |

### Tiered Storage

- **Hot tier** (`memory.json`) - Rules, mistakes, recent memories. Loaded by hooks on every tool call.
- **Cold tier** (`archive.json`) - Old inactive memories. Searchable, restorable, never loaded on hot path.
- Memories auto-archive after 14 days without access (configurable: `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_ARCHIVE_DAYS`).
- Rules never archive. Mistakes: manual ones never; auto-captured one-offs that went stale (3+ weeks, never recurred, away from current work) are archived by the background miner. Relevance **8+** exempts a memory from age-archiving entirely — deliberately above every default (manual `remember` is 5; the miner mints auto-captured decisions at 7). It was 7+, which exactly equalled the auto-capture default, so every auto-captured decision was born permanently exempt and the hot tier could not shrink.
- `cleanup` archives before deleting. Nothing is lost without review.
- `consolidate` is non-destructive: it keeps the 5 most relevant originals and **archives** the rest (searchable via `archive_search`, restorable by id). Scope it with `tag` — merging a group of hundreds into one paragraph loses the specifics that made each memory worth recalling.
- `cleanup` and `consolidate` solve different problems: cleanup drops NEAR-DUPLICATES (Jaccard and cosine at 0.85 — effectively the same memory stored twice), which is why it can report "0 duplicates" over hundreds of related decisions. `consolidate` merges a whole tag group into one LLM-written digest and archives the members. It needs 10+ entries in a group and never touches rules or mistakes (summarizing a specific actionable error into a vague blob destroys it).

### Smart Injection

Before every Edit/Write, the PreToolUse hook scores all hot memories against the current file context:

- 35% file path match (exact file > same dir > same extension > filename in content)
- 20% tag overlap (inferred from file path patterns)
- 20% recency (exponential decay over 30 days)
- 15% importance rating (1-10)
- 10% access frequency
- Rules get +0.3 bonus, mistakes get +0.2

File-path matching is path-aware: a shared basename across diverging paths (e.g. `service-a/myapp/__init__.py` vs `service-b/myapp/__init__.py`) is not treated as a match. Generic basenames like `__init__.py` or `index.js` require a full-path signal to score; specific filenames still match on name alone.

Top 3 are injected as context. You'll see them in the hook output before edits.

In multi-project workspaces, injection includes memories from the sub-project AND workspace-level memories (rules and mistakes cascade down).

Subagents (detected via `agent_id` in hook stdin) are handled differently: memory injection and hook output are skipped to preserve their limited context, but file edits are still tracked so the parent session knows what was modified.

### Decision Capture

User prompts are scored for decision intent using two tiers:

1. **Semantic scoring** (if `sentence-transformers` installed) - embedding cosine similarity against decision templates. A persistent scorer server (~1.1GB RAM with the default `bge-base-en-v1.5`, ~90MB with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`; ~5-25ms per call) auto-starts on session start and auto-exits after 30 min idle.
2. **Regex fallback** - Weighted keyword + sentence structure analysis. Always available, no dependencies.

Captures patterns like "let's use X", "switch to Y", "don't use Z", "from now on always W". Does not capture questions, requests for info, or ambiguous statements.

## Context Compaction

Handled automatically:

1. **PreCompact** hook saves checkpoint with task state and files in progress.
2. **PostCompact** hook re-injects rules, mistakes, and recent decisions.
3. No manual action needed. If you want deeper restore, call `session_start`.

## Session Mining

Automatically mines Claude Code session JSONL logs for intelligence that hooks can't capture.

**Automatic (no invocation):**
- **Background indexing**: SessionEnd spawns miner that indexes the session, extracts decisions/mistakes/approaches, builds search embeddings
- **Smart session start**: Shows last session context (files edited, activity, errors)
- **Pattern injection**: Recurring struggles and errors shown at session start
- **Predictive context**: Before edits, shows related files and likely errors from history
- **Bootstrap**: First session on a new project auto-detects existing history and mines it

**MCP tool (`session_mine`):**
- `search(query)` — semantic search across all past conversations; accepts a `kind` filter (`decision`/`next-step`/`error`/`narration`) to narrow results by hit type (regex-classified, no LLM)
- `decisions(query)` — find when/why a decision was made, with context
- `replay(file_path)` — find discussions about a specific file
- `predict(file_path)` — predict what context you'll need for an edit
- `commitments` — reads the LIVE transcript (newest *.jsonl, picked by newest last-message timestamp) for open-loop items: DEFERRED channel scans ~450 recent messages for next-session/remaining/TODO/follow-up/defer mentions; IN-FLIGHT channel scans last ~30 messages for I'll/let me/next actions. Heuristic, LLM-free. Run before asking "what next?" or on resume — it sees the open session, which the post-session mining index cannot.
- `reflect` — injection precision report: which context kinds (memory/prediction/precheck/blast) precede passing tests, plus LLM-synthesized insights from recurring mistakes/patterns
- `cross_project` — patterns across all your projects
- `overview` — project stats (sessions, messages, top files, errors)
- `reindex(mode=bootstrap)` — rebuild index from all session history

## Technical Notes

- Local LLM: Ollama with `gemma3:12b` (configurable via `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_MODEL`) — **optional**. Used only by `scout_search`, `memory(consolidate)`, and `session_mine(reflect)` insight synthesis. Both background ops degrade silently when Ollama is absent. Everything proactive (hooks, code index, precheck, blast-radius, injection scoring) is LLM-free.
- Storage: `~/.claude_engram/` (manifest.json, projects/\<hash\>/{memory.json, embeddings.npy, session_index.json, extractions/}, checkpoints/). Override the location with `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DIR`.
- Semantic scoring: configured encoder (default `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`) via persistent TCP server on localhost (auto-managed). The resident daemon stays on cpu (zero VRAM parked); bulk embedding jobs (>= `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_GPU_BULK_MIN`, default 512 texts) run in a transient GPU worker that exits after the job — full VRAM release. `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_DEVICE` forces one device everywhere; vectors are device-identical so stores never rebuild. `claude_engram_status` shows the daemon's device.
- Scorer daemon threading: connections are handled per-thread, but every MODEL call is submitted to one pinned worker thread (`_on_model_thread`). PyTorch retains per-thread state that is never freed when a thread dies, so encoding on the ephemeral connection thread leaked ~0.73 MB per request (dead-linear, +146 MB per 200 requests, no plateau). Never call the model directly from a request thread. Input is capped at `MAX_ENCODE_CHARS` (2000) server-side — the encoder discards past 512 tokens regardless, and uncapped text ratcheted the allocator high-water mark
- Hook daemon: the same server runs high-frequency hooks in-process (warm imports); hooks are thin `python -S` clients with a full in-process fallback when the daemon is down
- Ring vocabulary: a ring record carries ONE name per concept — `next_steps`, `files_in_progress`, `warnings`, `context_needed`, `decisions`, `created`. The checkpoint-side twins (`pending_steps`, `files_involved`, `handoff_warnings`, `handoff_context_needed`, `key_decisions`, `timestamp`) are no longer written; they were byte-identical in all 129 stored records that had both, and carrying both made the restore payload print every list twice. Records already on disk keep both, and every reader takes either — so there is no migration. **`task_description` and `summary` are NOT a twin pair**: `summary` is the handoff note (`handoff_summary or task_description`) and differed from the task title in 110 of those 129 records. The per-task `task_*.json` file keeps the checkpoint vocabulary and is untouched
- Checkpoint ring scope: a restore/list resolves the project's OWN ring, its DESCENDANT project rings, then its ancestors' — the global `checkpoints/` ring is a fallback used only when none of those exist. Descendants matter because a workspace root is a real place to restore from; without them a root-scoped restore read only the root ring and could return a stale entry while reporting success. Selection is by newest deliberate (manual) checkpoint, not by dir order, and responses name the store they came from
- Session identity: working state lives in `sessions/<session_id>.json` so concurrent sessions never clobber each other. Hooks read the id from their stdin payload; the MCP server adopts `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (exported to stdio MCP servers by Claude Code 2.1.154+) at startup, so MCP tools like `session_end` report THIS session instead of the shared fallback file. The scorer daemon deliberately opts out — one process serves many sessions and re-reads the id per request
- Outcome feedback: injection kinds that precede passing tests above baseline get a bounded scoring boost (0.8-1.2x), computed by the miner from `session_mine(reflect)` data
- Batch embeddings: `embed_batch` protocol for 22x faster bulk embedding (batch 256 on GPU, 64 on CPU)
- Session mining: background subprocess, fire-and-forget, no hook timeout impact; plus debounced live ticks at turn end (`CLAUDE_ENGRAM_LIVE_MINE`, default 300s) so the index tracks the running session
- Keep-alive: Set `CLAUDE_ENGRAM_KEEP_ALIVE=5m` to keep Ollama model loaded
- Hooks timeout: 1-2 seconds per hook. If a hook times out, it silently fails.
- All file writes use atomic temp-then-replace pattern.
- Hook installation merges into existing `~/.claude/settings.json` without destroying other hooks.
- Skill: `/engram` — quick reference installed to `~/.claude/skills/engram/`
