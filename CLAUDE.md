# Mini Claude - Project Instructions

**NOTE:** This file is for Claude Code (the AI). Copy it to your project root so Claude knows how to use Mini Claude tools effectively.

## STOP. READ THIS FIRST.

You have a junior dev (Mini Claude) who remembers things across sessions. **USE HIM.**

If you skip these steps, you WILL:
- Repeat mistakes you already made
- Forget why things are structured the way they are
- Break things you broke before

---

## MANDATORY: First Thing Every Session

```
mcp__mini-claude__session_start(project_path="<PROJECT_PATH>")
```

Replace `<PROJECT_PATH>` with the actual project directory.

**DO NOT SKIP THIS.** It loads your memories AND warns you about past mistakes.

---

## MANDATORY: Before Editing Shared/Important Files

Before editing files that are shared, config files, or core modules:

```
mcp__mini-claude__work_pre_edit_check(file_path="<the file>")
```

This shows past mistakes with that file. **If you skip this, you will repeat mistakes.**

---

## MANDATORY: When Something Breaks

When tests fail, something errors, or you have to undo work:

```
mcp__mini-claude__work_log_mistake(
  description="What went wrong",
  file_path="which file",
  how_to_avoid="How to prevent this"
)
```

**If you don't log mistakes, you WILL repeat them next session.**

---

## RECOMMENDED: For Multi-File Tasks

When working on a task that spans multiple files:

```
mcp__mini-claude__scope_declare(
  task_description="What you're doing",
  in_scope_files=["file1.py", "file2.py"]
)
```

This prevents scope creep and over-refactoring.

---

## RECOMMENDED: Log Important Decisions

When you choose between approaches or make architectural decisions:

```
mcp__mini-claude__work_log_decision(
  decision="What you decided",
  reason="Why"
)
```

Next session, you'll know WHY things are the way they are.

## Quick Reference

| When | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Start of session | `session_start` | Load context + past mistakes |
| Before editing important files | `work_pre_edit_check` | See past mistakes with file |
| Something breaks | `work_log_mistake` | Remember for next time |
| Make a decision | `work_log_decision` | Explain WHY for future |
| Multi-file task | `scope_declare` | Prevent over-refactoring |
| Before big changes | `impact_analyze` | See what depends on file |
| End of session | `work_save_session` | Persist work to memory |
| Before long tasks | `context_checkpoint_save` | Survive context compaction |
| When claiming done | `context_self_check` | Verify you actually did it |

## What Is Mini Claude?

Mini Claude is an MCP server that gives you (Claude Code):
1. **Persistent memory** - Survives across sessions
2. **Mistake tracking** - Warns you about past errors
3. **Work journaling** - Tracks what you do
4. **Loop detection** - Warns when you're editing same file 3+ times
5. **Scope guard** - Warns when you edit outside declared scope
6. **Impact analysis** - Shows what breaks before you break it

Runs locally with Ollama + `qwen2.5-coder:7b`.

## Why This Exists

AI coding assistants:
- Forget context between sessions
- Don't learn project conventions
- **Repeat the same mistakes**
- Get stuck in death spirals
- Over-refactor and break things
- Generate code that fails silently

Mini Claude fixes this by giving you memory and self-awareness tools.
**But they only work if you use them.**
